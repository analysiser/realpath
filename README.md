# realpath
Usage:
Check out the code to anywhere your $PATH is happy with, I personally like /usr/local/bin.
Then perform # sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/realpath.
Python based.

Rant:
So basically I'm so tired of not having a 'realpath' in macosx and I don't think there is one in homebrew...
And I think to rewrite a cross-platform c program is a overkill...
Feel free to do whatever you want with this. If you want to improve it just do it.
